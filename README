This is a readability calculator library for Python.

You're able to calculate the readability of a text using several algorithms:
 - Flesch-Kincaid
 - Coleman-Liau
 - Dale-Chall
 - SMOG
 - Automated Readability Index
 - Flesch Reading Ease (does not have min_age)

Dutch:
 - Flesch-Douma
 - KPC (AVI)


All available calculators have a min_age property which describes the typical minimum age for a potential reader.

Although the algorithms themselves might not be language independent, they can be called as such using a custom locale. This locale has to be available as a myspell dictionary. By default, the locale is set to 'en_GB'.
